        explanation: "First, multiply the second equation by $3$ to align the $x$ terms: $3(x - 2y) = 3(-1)$, giving $3x - 6y = -3$.

        correctAnswerIndex: 0,
        explanation: `To eliminate $y$, multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$ to align the $y$ terms:
        $3(3x + 2y) = 3(6)$ gives $9x + 6y = 18$,
        and 
        $2(5x + 3y) = 2(11)$ gives $10x + 6y = 22$. 
        Now subtract the first equation from the second: 
        $(10x + 6y) - (9x + 6y) = 22 - 18$.
        This simplifies to $x = 4$. 
        Substitute $x = 4$ back into the first equation $3x + 2y = 6$ to find:
        $3(4) + 2y = 6$,

        answers: ["Bolts cost \\$0.40, washers cost \\$0.10", "Bolts cost \\$0.20, washers cost \\$0.20", "Bolts cost \\$0.10, washers cost \\$0.30", "Bolts cost \\$0.30, washers cost \\$0.10"],
        correctAnswerIndex: 2,
        explanation: `Let $x$ be the cost of a bolt and $y$ be the cost of a washer. The problem gives the following system of equations based on the purchases:

        $4x + 6y = 2.20$
        
        $3x + 5y = 1.80$
        
        To solve, multiply the first equation by $3$ and the second by $4$ to align the coefficients of $x$:
        
        $12x + 18y = 6.60$
        
        $12x + 20y = 7.20$
        
        Now, subtract the first equation from the second:
        
        $2y = 0.60$
        
        Solving for $y$ gives $y = 0.30$, so the cost of a washer is \\$0.30. Substitute $y = 0.30$ into the first equation:
        
        $4x + 6(0.30) = 2.20$
        
        Simplifying, $4x + 1.80 = 2.20$, which gives $4x = 0.40$, so $x = 0.10$. Therefore, bolts cost \\$0.10, and washers cost \\$0.30.`

        correctAnswerIndex: 1,
        explanation: `Let $x$ be the cost of a fruit juice and $y$ be the cost of a vanilla thick shake. The problem provides the following two equations:

        $y = x + 2$ (since a thick shake is \\$2 more than a fruit juice)
        
        $3y + 5x = 30$ (cost of 3 thick shakes and 5 fruit juices)
        
        Substitute $y = x + 2$ into the second equation:
        
        $3(x + 2) + 5x = 30$
        
        Expanding and simplifying:
        
        $3x + 6 + 5x = 30$
        
        $8x + 6 = 30$
        
        Subtract $6$ from both sides:
        
        $8x = 24$
        
        Divide by $8$:
        
        $x = 3$
        
        So, the cost of a fruit juice is \\$3. Substitute $x = 3$ into $y = x + 2$:
        
        $y = 3 + 2 = 5$
        
        Therefore, the cost of a thick shake is \\$5, and the cost of a fruit juice is \\$3.`
