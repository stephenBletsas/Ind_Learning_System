        question: `Solve for $x$: $3x + 5 = 20$`,
        answers: ["$x = 3$", "$x = 5$", "$x = 6$", "$x = 7$"],
        correctAnswerIndex: 1,
        explanation: "To solve for $x$ in the equation $3x + 5 = 20$, you need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Start by subtracting $5$ from both sides, which simplifies the equation to $3x = 15$. Next, divide both sides by $3$ to solve for $x$, resulting in $x = 5$. Therefore, the correct answer is $x = 5$."

        question: `Solve for $y$: $4y âˆ’ 7 = 9$`,
        answers: ["$y = 2$", "$y = 3$", "$y = 4$", "$y = 5$"],
        correctAnswerIndex: 2,
        explanation: "To solve for $y$ in the equation $4y - 7 = 9$, you need to isolate the variable on one side. Start by adding $7$ to both sides of the equation, which gives $4y = 16$. Then, divide both sides by $4$ to solve for $y$, resulting in $y = 4$. Therefore, the correct answer is $y = 4$."
